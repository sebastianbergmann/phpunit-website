                        in February 2020. Quite the opposite, especially "under the hood".

                        <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 10</span> is the most significant release in the history of the
                        PHPUnit project (<a href="https://thephp.cc/presentations/phpunit-past-present-future?ref=phpunit">which began 23 years ago</a>).
                        This release is to PHPUnit what <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHP 7</span>
                        was to PHP: a massive cleanup, refactoring, and modernisation that lays the groundwork for future development.

                        We are confident that <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 10</span> works as intended, but in some respects
                        it works differently than previous versions. For example, functionality marked as deprecated in
                        <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 9</span> has been removed in <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 10</span>.
                        You should not even try to upgrade to <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 10</span> if you cannot run your test suite
                        with <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 9.6</span> without getting deprecation warnings.
                    </p>
                    <p class="wrapped">
                        If you use a third-party test double library such as Prophecy, for instance, you will need to either rewrite your tests
                        or wait for a version of the third-party test double library you use that is compatible with <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 10</span>.
                        The out-of-the-box support for Prophecy in PHPUnit was deprecated in <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 9</span>
                        and has now been removed for <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 10</span>.

                        If you use a third-party extension for PHPUnit's test runner then you will have to wait for a version of the
                        third-party extension that is compatible with <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 10</span>. The vendors of such extensions need to migrate their
                        code from the old <code>TestListener</code> and <code>Hook</code> systems to the new event system.

                    <p class="wrapped">
                        If you use a tool such as Infection or ParaTest that wraps PHPUnit's test runner then you will have to wait for a
                        version of that tool that is compatible with <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 10</span>. The same holds true for alternative test runners such
                        as Pest.

                        Please note that the documentation has not been updated for <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 10</span>
                        yet. We are in the process of reviewing, updating, and in some cases rewriting the documentation for

                    <p class="wrapped">
                        Previous versions of PHPUnit provided the <code>TestListener</code> interface as well as the
                        <code>TestHook</code> interfaces for developers of extensions for PHPUnit's test runner. Both of
                        these approaches for extending PHPUnit's test runner had <a href="https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4676">severe drawbacks</a>.
                        <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 10</span> replaces the <code>TestListener</code> and
                        <code>TestHook</code> interfaces with an event system: (almost) everything is an event now.
                        All output, both to the console and to log files, is now based on events.
                    </p>
                    <p class="wrapped">
                        The development of this event system has been led by <a href="https://thephp.cc/company/consultants/arne-blankerts?ref=phpunit">Arne Blankerts</a>

                    <p class="wrapped">
                        Following the best practice of "eating your own dog food", we refactored (and in some cases rewrote)
                        PHPUnit's internal code that used to use the <code>TestListener</code> interface and <code>ResultPrinter</code>
                        classes to use the event system instead. By forcing ourselves to use events for all output, to the console as
                        well as to logfiles, we discovered many confusing and/or missing events early on.
                    </p>
                    <p class="wrapped">
                        The new event system is not only superior to the previous <code>TestListener</code> and <code>Hook</code> approaches.
                        The work on the event system had a ripple effect throughout PHPUnit's entire codebase. A lot of technical debt was
                        finally paid off. Finding the right places to emit the right events revealed countless previously hidden
                        inconsistencies and problems.
                    </p>
                    <p class="wrapped">
                        For example, for the <code>TestRunner\Configured</code> event, we needed a canonical and immutable representation
                        of the configuration. As a result, the code that loads the XML configuration is now better. And the code that handles
                        the CLI arguments is better. And most importantly, the code that combines these two configuration sources into
                        "the configuration" is now better. Once we had "the configuration", we realised that we could now implement large parts
                        of the CLI test runner much more easily. This allowed us to clean up other parts, and so on and so forth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="wrapped">
                        The event system is "read only". Developers can write extensions for PHPUnit's test runner and subscribe to events.
                        The <code>Event</code> objects passed to subscribers as well as any value object aggregated in such an <code>Event</code>
                        object is immutable.

                        We regret that <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 10</span> and its new event system require significant changes
                        to extensions for and/or wrappers around PHPUnit's test runner. We are confident that in the long run, the developers of
                        such extensions or wrappers will appreciate the benefits of the new event system over its predecessors.

                        The feedback we have received so far is very promising: Already in October 2021,
                        <a href="https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4807#issuecomment-953671212">Nuno Maduro</a>
                        informed us that the migration of Pest from the old test listeners to the new event system was a "great" experience.
                        The discussions we had with <a href="https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4993">Filippo Tessarotto</a>
                        were crucial in ensuring that solutions like ParaTest can be updated to work with <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 10</span>.

                        <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 10</span> introduces a clear separation between the <em>outcome</em> (errored, failed, incomplete, skipped, or passed)
                        of a test and the <em>issues</em> (considered risky, triggered a warning, ...) of a test.

                        The error handler of <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 9</span> (optionally) converted <code>E_(USER_)WARNING</code>, <code>E_(USER_)NOTICE</code>,
                        <code>E_(USER_)DEPRECATED</code>, etc. to exceptions. These exceptions aborted the execution of a test and made
                        PHPUnit consider the test to have errored.
                    </p>

                        The error handler of <span style="white-space: nowrap;">PHPUnit 10</span> no longer converts <code>E_(USER_)WARNING</code>, <code>E_(USER_)NOTICE</code>,
                        <code>E_(USER_)DEPRECATED</code>, etc. to exceptions. Therefore, the execution of a test is no longer aborted
                        when an <code>E_USER_NOTICE</code> is triggered, for instance. Consequently, such a test is no longer considered
                        to have errored.
