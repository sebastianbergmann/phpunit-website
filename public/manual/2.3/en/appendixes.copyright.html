Creative Commons Legal Code
Attribution 2.0

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN
ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR
DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS
YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF
SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
      anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
      unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
      constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
      assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
      Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
      defined below) for the purposes of this License.

   b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the
      Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,
      musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion
      picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
      condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
      transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
      Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
      purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
      Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the
      synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
      image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the
      purpose of this License.

   c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work
      under the terms of this License.

   d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

   e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under
      the terms of this License.

   f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
      License who has not previously violated the terms of this
      License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
      permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this
      License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
   limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or
   other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner
   under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
   Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
   copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
   below:

   a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
      Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in
      the Collective Works;

   b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

   c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
      perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital
      audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
      Collective Works;

   d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
      perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital
      audio transmission Derivative Works.

   e.

      For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

         i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor
            waives the exclusive right to collect, whether
            individually or via a performance rights society
            (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
            performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
            of the Work.

        ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives
            the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or
            via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry
            Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from
            the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the
            compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US
            Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

   f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
      doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
      exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
      performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for
      the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work,
      subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114
      of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
      jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
   made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
      publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
      License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
      Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of
      the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
      publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any
      terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this
      License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
      hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact
      all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
      warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
      perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any
      technological measures that control access or use of the Work in
      a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License
      Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
      Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work
      apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
      this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from
      any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
      the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the
      Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work,
      upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
      practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to
      such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

   b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
      publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or
      Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for
      the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the
      medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
      pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the
      title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
      practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
      Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such
      URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
      information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work,
      a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
      (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
      "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such
      credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
      however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective
      Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
      comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
      prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
   APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
   LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
   OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
   WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
      License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative
      Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however,
      will not have their licenses terminated provided such
      individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
      licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
      termination of this License.

   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright
      in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
      right to release the Work under different license terms or to
      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or
      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work
      or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
      license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the
      license granted to You under this License.

   b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
      Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
      the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
      license granted to You under this License.

   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
      to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver
      or consent.

   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
      parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
      the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
      additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
      You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
      agreement of the Licensor and You.

Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty
whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be
liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages
whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,
incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this
license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the
Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark
"Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative
Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any
permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons'
then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its
